This is a sample template git repo for [Wupiter](https://wupiter.com), a web app that allows dev teams to easily create custom code generators.

These code generators (Accelerators) can help reduce repetitive coding tasks (ie: creating new projects), share best practices and accelerate ramp up time on new projects.
